Fantasy sports, stock markets, and the NCAA March Madness tournament are all very popular in the United States, so in this app, we combined them! This hybrid of fantasy sports with a stock market allows users to buy their favorite teams like stocks. Everyone starts off with $1000 of in game currency when they create account, and with that, they can purchase their favorite teams. At the end of the season, points are tallied up based on how well the team performs throughout the tournament, and the user with the best portfolio wins!
